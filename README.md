## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

Junior Data Scientist passionate about AI and science in general, songwriter, and filmmaker.

After starting with the technical side of computer science through low-level coding in C then moving on to web development courses, I was still in pursue of something more focused on investigation, critical thinking and creativity.
I started using AI in January 2023, and impressed by the power of the technology and the future it could shape, I immediately dug deeper to understand the process. I then discovered the field it was related to was Data Science.

This was the match I was looking for ; aligning perfectly with my aspirations.

I decided to pursue this path and attended Le Wagon 'Data Science and AI' bootcamp, from which I graduated in September 2024 following the summer session. It fulfilled my expectations and confirmed I was headed in the right direction.
